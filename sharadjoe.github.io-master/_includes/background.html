      I'm currently an Forth Year Engineering Student at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.upstatement.com/" target="_blank">College Of Engineering Chengannur</a> building things for the web with some awesome people.

      As a developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences. I also love to attend hackathons. I've been  &mdash;
      attending hackathons for the past 3 years and won a few.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably fishing, hiking, playing PUBG Mobile,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
